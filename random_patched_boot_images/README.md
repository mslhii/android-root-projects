### Random Patched Boot and recovery/vbmeta/other miscellaneous Images
New and patched boot and recovery images are to be uploaded to this repository as well as vbmeta and other random images.

Preloaders may or may not be uploaded to this repository because of possible or potential copyright issues? Also some of those preloaders may or may not be compatible with other devices because of possible incompatibilities even though the devices have the same chipsets.

Uploads also may or may not be restricted due to the above reasons. Uploads will also be slow because of work commitments (really slammed with work over the past year). Also any large binaries or other partitions will not be uploaded in order to not clutter up other people's repositories with irrelevant files.

Update: there will be no more updates because there have been no more exploits available for a long time, even old
